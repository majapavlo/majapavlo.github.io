#### Note to self for in a year (Lazy Brain)


Install node (node js) = package manager for JavaScript  (equivalent of pip (python))


Install a node package called light-server
CMD `npm install light-server`

The package.json file (equivalent of requirements.txt) contains list of all the packages to install
CMD `npm install` when in correct directory
package.json scripts section: contains command line scripts (short-cuts) example `npx lite-server -s .`can now be run with `npm run start` or `npm start`


This will tell me which port the server is running on:

light-server is listening at http://0.0.0.0:4000  => Go to http://localhost:4000

- Terminal: Ctrl + C to exit

------

- .css --> cascading style sheets contains the styles (e.g., fonts, colors, spacing)
- .html --> contains the structure and content
