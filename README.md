## Usage

Installed node (node js) = package manager for JavaScript  (equivalent of pip (python)), then installed dependencies with:

```bash
$ npm install
```

In the project directory  `npm start` runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page should normally reload automatically after editing the code.<br>

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `dist` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles Solid in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>

## Deployment

The `dist` folder can be deployed to any static host provider (e.g. github pages)
